#Demo 1 - Pulling a Container from a Private Container Registry


#To create a private repository in our registry, follow the directions here
#https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#private-repositories


#Then let's log into docker...I've already done this so it's using the configuration in config.json
sudo docker login 


#Let's pull down a hello-world image from gcr
sudo docker pull gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0


#Let's get our image ID so we can tag it locally
sudo docker image ls gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app


#tagging our image in the format your registry, image and tag
#You'll be using your own repository, so update that information here. 
sudo docker tag bc5c421ecd6c nocentino/hello-app:ps


#Now push that locally tagged image into our private registry at docker hub
#You'll be using your own repository, so update that information here. 
sudo docker push nocentino/hello-app:ps


#We need to adjust permissions on our config.json file, since I did a sudo docker login earlier...
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) ~/.docker/
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) ~/.docker/config.json


#Create our secret that we'll use for our image pull...from our docker config.json
#This is of type generic, for docker-registry, look at line 48
kubectl create secret generic private-reg-cred \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=/home/aen/.docker/config.json \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson


#...or if needed we can specify this explicitly using the following parameters
kubectl create secret docker-registry private-reg-cred \
    --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ \
    --docker-username=$USERNAME \
    --docker-password=$PASSWORD \
    --docker-email=$EMAIL


#Ensure the image doesn't exist on any of our nodes...or else we can get a false positive
#you'll be using your own repository, so update that information here.
